*** Note that the full version of the reference compiler is present,
*** and the output you're seeing by default is WAT code; use the
*** compiler's command-line options to stop and see its output at
*** earlier stages.

To run the J-- reference compiler:

% cd reference
% ./main -h				(for options)

% ./main -ptokenize testfile		(for scanner output)

The scanner output is a list of tokens.  Each token is a triple
(token type as string, line number as integer, token lexeme as string).
Note that the EOF is implicit in the list ending, so there's no
explicit EOF token being produced here.

% ./main -pparse testfile		(for parser AST output)
% ./main -psemantic testfile		(for post-semantic checking AST output)
